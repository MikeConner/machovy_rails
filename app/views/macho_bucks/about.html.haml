    %h2== How the #{I18n.t('macho_bucks')} program works...
    %p== #{I18n.t('macho_bucks')} are real dollars you can use just about anywhere on Machovy.com.
    %ul
      %li Buy Machovy gift certificates for your friends (even if they don't have an account yet)
      %li Refer a friend -- or merchant -- to the site; we'll reward you with #{I18n.t('macho_bucks')} on their first purchase
      %li== If you need to return a voucher... receive credit #{I18n.t('macho_bucks')}
    %p When you purchase a local deal through Machovy, we'll use your #{I18n.t('macho_bucks')} balance first, then charge your card for any remainder.
    %em Affiliate deals (e.g., Amazon) send you directly to the merchant; that's the only time you can't use #{I18n.t('macho_bucks')}
