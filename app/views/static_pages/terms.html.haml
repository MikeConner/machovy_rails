          %h5 General
          %p This website provides an online service operated by Machovy, Inc. on the world wide web consisting of the offer for sale and fulfillment of discount vouchers ("Vouchers") offered by various merchants ("Merchants") which may be exchanged for goods and/or services provided by Merchants and/or third parties. This Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions that apply to the use of this website by you, the end user. By using this website, you agree to comply with and be bound by all of the terms and conditions set forth herein. The right to use this site is personal to you, and is not transferable to any other person or entity.

          %h5 Modification of Terms and Conditions
          %p Machovy, Inc. reserves the right at all times to change or discontinue any of these Terms and Conditions to the extent deemed necessary or desirable without prior notification to you. We suggest, therefore, that you re-read this important notice containing our Terms of Use from time to time in order that you stay informed as to any such changes. Such changes may include, among other things, the adding of certain fees or charges. Any changes to these Terms and Conditions will take effect upon the earlier of our action to send an e-mail notice to you or our posting of notice of the changes on our website.

          %h5 Using a Credit Card and your Billing/Statement
          %p Machovy, Inc. does not sell products to children or teens, but does sell to adults, who can purchase with a credit card.

        %li
          %h5 Expiration Dates/Disputes/Closed Merchants
          %p The expiration date on the Voucher sets forth the last date on which you can redeem your Voucher for the full promotional value as stated on the Voucher, but applicable law may provide that the Merchant is responsible for honoring the cash value that you paid for the Voucher for a period of time beyond that expiration date. If you have an expired Voucher and would like to redeem it, please present it at the Merchant to redeem the Voucher for the price paid for it. If you have presented the Voucher to the Merchant and the Merchant has refused to either redeem the Voucher for the purchase price or refund the purchase price to you, your remedy is vis-a-vis the Merchant. Machovy is not an arbitor and all disputes must be resolved directly with the Merchant. Failure to resolve the same may necessitate legal action by you directly against the Merchant. Machovy directly disclaims any such liability. However, if the Merchant has closed and the prior redemption of the Voucher has not occurred, and it is prior to the expiration date, then and only in that case, Machovy will refund the money paid for the Voucher.

We reserve the right at any time after receipt of your order, without prior notice to you, to supply less than the quantity you ordered of any product or service, with notice to you if this should occur, and apply a credit to your credit card if applicable.
