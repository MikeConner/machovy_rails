MERCHANT SERVICE AGREEMENT</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>These Machovy Merchant Service
Agreement Standard Terms &amp; Conditions together with a Merchant Service
Agreement Order Form (each an “Order Form”) entered into by the Machovy Entity
(“Machovy”) and Merchant (each as specified on the Order Form, and each a
“Party” and together the “Parties”) are collectively referred to herein as the
“Agreement.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Nature
of Services</u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>This Agreement relates to the
placement of marketing and promotion services by Merchant with</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

 class=WordSection2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Machovy. Machovy will promote and
authorize third parties to promote a Voucher for the Merchant Product with the
particular Deal characteristics identified in the Order Form, in accordance
with this Agreement. The Merchant is the “issuer” of the Voucher for its Deal.
Machovy acts as the seller of record for the Voucher on behalf of Merchant, but
the Merchant is ultimately the provider of the Merchant Product and is the
obligor with regard to the Voucher.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>2. <u>Machovy Responsibilities</u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>a. <u>Deal Creatives</u>. Machovy
may use Merchant Content to prepare one or more promotional creatives for the
particular Deal (“Deal Creatives”), in its discretion, which may include a Deal
page and other content hosted on the Machovy.com website, Machovy affiliate website(s),
other websites platforms, or other media platforms or outlets offered by third
parties with whom we have a distribution relationship (“Promotion Channels”),
an email creative to be distributed to potential purchasers of the Deal
Voucher, and other creatives for online and other promotion of the Deal. Deal
Creatives will be provided to Merchant for prior approval (which approval may
be made by email), not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Merchant agrees
and acknowledges that Deal Creative shall be deemed to be approved if Machovy
has not&nbsp; received contrary instructions from Merchant within 72 hours.
Once a Deal Creative has been approved or has been deemed to be approved,
Machovy shall have the right to use and promote other Deal Creatives that are
substantially similar to the approved Deal Creative (e.g., Deal Creatives that
have been reformatted).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>b. <u>Promotion.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>i. Machovy may offer and promote
the Merchant product or service identified in the Order Form (the “Merchant
Product”) through one or more of the Promotion Channels on the terms and
conditions described in the Order Form (the “Deal”), including the price to be
paid by the purchaser (the “Paid Value”).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>ii. The scheduled time periods
that each Deal is marketed and offered as a Deal promoted within one of the
Machovy-designated verticals (e.g., Daily Deals, etc.) (“Offer Periods”) will
be designated&nbsp; by Merchant.&nbsp; Following the initial general Offer
Period, unless Merchant notifies Machovy prior to the Offer Period that it does
not wish to participate in an additional promotion, Merchant agrees and
acknowledges that if the Maximum Vouchers to be Sold as indicated in the
Initial Order Form or subsequent Insertion Orders is not reached by the end of
the Offer Period, Machovy shall have the right to continue to promote the Deal
through one or more of its Promotion Channels at such later dates, in its
discretion, until it reaches the Maximum Vouchers to be Sold. If Merchant has
indicated that there is no cap on the Maximum Vouchers to be Sold in the
Initial Order Form or subsequent Insertion Orders, Machovy shall have the right
to sell up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the purchased Vouchers from the
Offer Period through its Promotion Channels at later dates. Merchant shall send
any notice electing not to participate in the additional promotions set forth
in the immediately preceding sentences to the Production Contact identified in
the Initial Order Form or subsequent Insertion Orders.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>iii. Vouchers. Machovy and its
third party Promotion Channels will provide each purchaser of a Deal (each a
“Purchaser”) a numbered Voucher which specifies both the Paid Value and the
Promotional Value associated with the Deal (each a “Voucher”). Within one
business day following the end of the Offer Period, Machovy will provide
Merchant with the names of all persons having the right to redeem the Vouchers
and the corresponding Voucher numbers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>iv. Additional Orders. The Order
Form attached hereto is the “Initial Order Form”. From time to time, the
parties may decide in their discretion to promote additional Deals, subject to
the parties’ execution one or more written “Insertion Orders” which shall be
substantially in the form of the Order Form, with regard to such additional
Deals, which shall incorporate these Standard Terms &amp; Conditions by
reference.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>3. <u>Merchant
Responsibilities</u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>a. <u>Issuer</u>. Merchant agrees
and acknowledges that Machovy and its third party Promotion Channels market, is
the seller of record for, the Deal on behalf of Merchant, but that Merchant remains
the issuer of the Vouchers, the provider of the Merchant Product and the
obligor with regard to the Voucher. Accordingly Merchant agrees that it, and
not Machovy or its Promotion Channels, is solely responsible to fulfill the
Deal and provide the Merchant Product to the individual redeeming each Voucher
in accordance with this Agreement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>b. <u>Fulfillment</u>. Merchant
agrees to honor and fulfill all Vouchers sold for the Deal in accordance with
the terms of the Deal, the standard Machovy Terms and Conditions posted on <a
href="http://www.livingsocial.com/terms,"><span style='color:blue'>http://www.machovy.com/terms,</span></a>
this Agreement, and any applicable laws. Merchant agrees to accept Vouchers in
any form presented for redemption that has been approved by Machovy, including,
without limitation, a physical printout of the Voucher or by displaying the
Voucher on a mobile device such as a smartphone at the point of service.&nbsp;
Merchant agrees that in fulfilling the Voucher, it will not require any
payments or impose any conditions that were not disclosed to the Purchaser in
the terms of the Voucher. Merchant shall not treat Voucher holders differently
from other paying customers in the scheduling (e.g., use of blackout dates and
times) or delivery of services, except as expressly set forth in the Deal.
Vouchers for a specified value or discount shall be redeemable for goods or
services priced at the same level and on the same terms as other paying
customers. For Deals that require advance scheduling, Merchant shall use its
best efforts to accommodate the scheduling request of the Voucher holder.
Except as otherwise expressly set forth in the Deal, if the Voucher holder
contacts Merchant prior to the applicable Expiration Date for the purpose of
scheduling service thereafter, the customer shall get the full benefit of the
Promotional Value.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>c. <u>Merchant Content</u>.
Merchant may be asked to provide a logo, photograph, or other marketing
materials (“Merchant Content”) to be used to market the Merchant Product.
Merchant hereby grants Machovy a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable,
royalty-free and worldwide license to reproduce, use, display, perform,
distribute, adapt, reformat, and create derivative works (as Deal Creatives)
based upon some or all of the Merchant Content for the purpose of developing,
distributing, and otherwise promoting a Deal through its Promotion Channels as
Machovy deems appropriate (including by sublicensing the foregoing rights to
its Promotion Channels). Merchant will not provide any Merchant Content for
which it cannot grant the licenses described in this Paragraph. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>d. <u>Redemption Data.</u>
Merchant shall collect and provide to Machovy on a regular basis, no less
frequently than monthly, a list of the serial numbers of redeemed Vouchers.
Merchant shall provide this information by using Machovy’s Merchant Center
through which Merchant can record such data.&nbsp; Notwithstanding anything in
this Paragraph, it is recommended that Merchant redeem its Vouchers upon
presentation for use as a protection against fraudulent, counterfeit or forged
Vouchers.&nbsp; Merchant is directed to Paragraph 4(d) herein.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>e.&nbsp; <u>Non-redeemed vouchers</u>.&nbsp;
Any and all payments for vouchers issued but not redeemed by the expiration
shall be held in escrow by Machovy for one year post the expiration date
thereof.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>4. <u>Fees and Payment</u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>a. <u>Marketing Fee</u>. In
consideration for fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement, Machovy will
be entitled to retain the Marketing Fee set forth in the Order Form on all
payments received from Purchasers of the Vouchers. Merchant authorizes Machovy
to deduct its Marketing Fee from the Merchant Payment made pursuant to Section
4(b). The Marketing Fee shall have been earned upon the promotion of the Deal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>b. <u>Merchant Payment</u>.
Subject to Merchant’s performance of all of its obligations under this
Agreement, Machovy shall remit to Merchant all payments received from
Purchasers of Vouchers minus the Marketing Fee and the Credit Card Processing
Fee for the Deal Promotion specified in the Order Form (the 'Merchant
Payment'). Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties in writing, the amounts due
to Merchant shall be paid to Merchant within thirty (30) days after
redemption.&nbsp; Notwithstanding any other provision herein, there will be no
payment due or made prior to the redemption of said vouchers as provided herein
in Paragraph 3(d).&nbsp; Subject to the preceding, Merchant Payment shall be as
follows:&nbsp; (negotiated, agreed upon rate as defined in Paragraph (c)
herein%) of the Merchant Payment owed, less any returns and refunds, will be transferred
to the Merchant Account within ten (10) business days after any request
pursuant to this Paragraph. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>c.&nbsp; <u>Negotiated, Agreed
upon Rate.</u>&nbsp; Merchant shall suggest the applicable percentage
acceptable for any and all voucher agreements payable to (retained by) Machovy
subject to acceptance by the latter.&nbsp; Said rate, upon acceptance by
Machovy, shall be the applicable rate utilized in Paragraph (b) herein.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>d.&nbsp; <u>Forged, Counterfeit
or Otherwise Fraudulent Vouchers</u>.&nbsp; Because it is in Merchant’s
capacity to police the system for forged, counterfeit or otherwise fraudulent
Vouchers by redeeming the same instantaneously with presentation, all liability
for the same shall be solely the responsibility of Merchant
hereunder.&nbsp;&nbsp; Machovy shall have no liability for reimbursement or
set-off for any such Vouchers.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>e. <u>Taxes</u>. Merchant will be
solely responsible for collecting and remitting any value added, use or sales
taxes owed to federal, state, or local taxing authorities in connection with
the sale or redemption of Vouchers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>f. <u>Scheduling</u> Merchant
understands that the success of the Deal is dependent upon coordination in
promotion planning. To ensure the success of the Deal, Merchant agrees that it
will not promote or authorize the promotion of the same or similar Deal online,
including without limitation on any other daily deal or flash sale website upon
the later of the date of notice of the Offer Period or the date fifteen days
prior to the Offer Period start date and continue until the later of the date
thirty (30) days following the date of notice or the date fifteen (15) days
following the end of the Offer Period (“Quiet Period”). If a scheduled Offer
Period needs to be rescheduled due to actions within the sole control of
Merchant, including failure to honor the Quiet Period, then Machovy may in its
discretion increase the Marketing Fee by up to 10% of the Paid Value for
Vouchers sold.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>5</b>. <b><u>Request for
Refunds</u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Merchant agrees that Machovy is
not an arbiter of any claims hereunder, and as such will not intervene in a dispute
arising out of the adequacy of goods or services provided.&nbsp; Any request
for refunds by a consumer hereunder shall be directed to the Merchant for
disposition.&nbsp; Machovy, however, shall not be liable to return any amounts
once said Voucher has been redeemed to either Merchant or consumer hereunder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>6</b>. <b>Representations and

third parties, and (c) it complies and will comply with applicable laws and
regulations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

or other proprietary right, (c) it has all valid federal, state, and local
licenses and or permits required to conduct its business and perform the Deal,
(d) it will comply with applicable federal and state laws related to offering,

acknowledges that the Deal terms will state both in the Deal Creatives and on
the printed Voucher that the Promotional Value of the Voucher expires after a
stated Expiration Date, and that the Paid Value does not expire or expires on a
later date, as permitted or required by law. Merchant is responsible for
ensuring that information printed on the Voucher complies with applicable state
and federal laws relating to gift certificates, and Merchant is responsible for
enforcing expiration of the Vouchers only in accordance with applicable federal
and state laws. In addition, if a Purchaser redeems a Voucher for less than the
Paid Value, federal and state laws may require that the Merchant, upon request,
provide the Purchaser or holder of a Voucher cash redemption equal to the
difference between the Paid Value and the amount redeemed. Merchant, and not
Machovy or its Promotion Channels, is responsible to comply with any cash
redemption requirements.</p>

arbitrarily inflate prices on its website or at its location due to the
Promotion, and (d) the Deal Promotional Value identified in the Order Form or
any subsequent Insertion Order is a true discount and the Merchant Product will
not be available on any other website for free or at a better value.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>7.<b> Indemnification</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>a. <u>Indemnity</u> Merchant
shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Machovy, its directors, officers,
employees, agents, and third party Promotion Channels from and against any and all
claims, demands, causes of action, or liabilities, and expenses, including

Merchant Content, Merchant Product or the fulfillment thereof, and/or any
breach or alleged breach of any Merchant obligation, representation, or
warranty under this Agreement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>b. <u>Process</u>. Machovy must
notify Merchant promptly in writing of any claim for indemnification hereunder,
and provide, at Merchant’s expense (to the extent of out-of-pocket expenses only),
all reasonably necessary assistance, information and authority to allow
Merchant to control the defense and settlement of such claim, provided that the
failure of Machovy to promptly inform Merchant of any claim shall not excuse
Merchant of its obligations under this Section except to the extent such
failure materially prejudices Merchant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Merchant
shall not enter into any settlement of the defense of such action, other than
with respect to the payment of monies, without Machovy’s prior written consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Machovy may
participate at its expense in the defense and/or settlement of any such action
